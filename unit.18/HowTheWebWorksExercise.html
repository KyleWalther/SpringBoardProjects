        Questions
What is HTTP?- Hyper Text Tranfor Protocol, electronic communication protocols between computers. It helps communicate by setting up rules in which responses and request arre sent. A standerdized way to move and return requests and responses.
What is a URL?- Universal recourse Locators, contains components. First the protocall “http”, then the host name “reddit.com”, then the port number “80” then the resource “/wehat we want to access”, then finly the querystring “a optional way to show additional information about the page your visiting., it will show you what correlates with your qstring and the page you look up.”.
What is DNS? - A domain name system that takes a host name and takes you to the corisponding IP address.
What is a query string?- an optional way to show additional information about the page your on. You can also use specific keyword within the query string to specify what you want to see on a website as long as its reactive to the server information. 
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? - GET and POST, refers to what action we are making. A GET request is when your making a request without any changes or side effects. Examples are getting data, pages, or retrieving without changing the server data.They are made when you hit enter, click a link. A POST request with side effects. Change data on the server, sending info to be saved or deleted. It will impact the server. The POST is not sent through tht query string but rather the body of the page. Makng a post on Reddit is an example as it sends information that you entered into the body that the server in turn holds on to.Most sites dont let you make POST requests. PostBin demoenstrates different requests. 
What is an HTTP request?-  Contains meta data that you are wanting to see. A request must contain a method, a HTTP protocoll version, a URL you want, then the Headers. Headers are not mandatory.
What is an HTTP response?- the server constructs a page based on what the the request is specifying. It sends the response as data making up a webpage containing html css and javascript.A response contains a HTTP protocol version, a status code, and response headers.
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.- Headers are contained in a request and a  response specifying what happens and what is being set back. I’ve seen dates, languages, and hostnames.In reponses, it will also contain a response body of the webpage that your browser knows how to display. Response codes are codes that show you what the status of the response is. 200 is an example of a code that is returned if the page is all good, 404 is another that is shown when something goes wrong and it can not return properly, 301 is a redirect as if a webpage has a new url that its using or represented by.
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
You request a server to show you the webpage with somesite as a hostname, then accessing some/page.html as a recource to view.  this search in the browser is a request in that its sent to the server which then looks through the code it has and attempts to match the url, resources, and headers with what you’ve requested, responding with the code that the server has best fitting to your request. You then should see the webpage or will receive a response code redirecting or not showing the page if something goes wrong.
